# Bazaar Application

This is an Application I built in collaboration with BullsAndBears: The Financial Club of PDEU. The Idea behind the Application / Game is to help realise the youngsters the value of an information.

It is immensely important to have an information and one must know how to use it to his/her advantage. With this game the team has tried to create awareness into the youngsters on how important it is to be updated with the world and how important it is to watch NEWS on a daily basis.
NEWS can have huge impacts on our surroundings and one of things is the Share Market. Share Market fluctuates every second and can be rendered unstable by even the tiniest bit of information against it using the social media platforms like Whatsapp, Twitter, etc. Those may or may not be always correct and the decision to believe in the NEWS or not is completely on the individual himself.

It teaches the importance of NEWS thats around us all. Some are fake and some are not and we choose to believe in the right ones.
